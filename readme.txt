I set this project up inside of a folder titled ‘mtgm-test’ and created the ‘stylesheets’ and ‘js’ folders. I then created a new Sass project within ‘mtgs-test’ through the command line (which created the ‘sass’ directory) I then installed Bourbon and Neat through the command line (this installed the libraries into my ‘stylesheets’ directory.

Once everything was installed and I was ready to start working I started Compass and set it to watch all my .scss files. I then compiled through Compass to output my final .css

My development environment consisted of Sublime Text 3, Google Chrome & Mozilla FireFox with both browsers built in Dev Tools/FireBug.

I utilized a plugin called ‘owl carousel’ for the responsive carousel as well as the hamburger style “sliding menu” from http://refills.bourbon.io/components/.

Overall time spent on this project was around 4-5 hours. I did run into some system issues when initially trying to install the Bourbon/Neat libraries (permission issues with my machines ruby environment) which took me a rather lengthy amount of time to fix, however once the system issues were fixed, installation was a breeze.

Having no prior experience with Bourbon/Neat I do feel this wireframe took me about twice the amount of time it would have if I did have previous experience with the libraries. However, I see the power behind these libraries and will be teaching myself more.
